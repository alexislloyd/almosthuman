They were delicious cocktails, and led to a very fuzzy final day in NY
Nah, that's about right for New York.
Sorry.
/giphy [new york]
Well I'll have to add it to my list next time I visit.
*distillery
and you can see through a big window into the distilley and drool at equipment while imbibing tasty cocktails
Wow
Yes, but NoJ was once again very loud with DJ, so <@U03PX4FGH> found an aMAZing cocktail bar down the street that distills its own gin
<@U03PX4FGH>: Did you get <@U03PYAR4J> merry on lavendar cocktails too?
<@U03PYAR4J>: Oh good, you're functioning!
<@U03PZUMNG>: yes - somewhere in west village around 11.30?
<@U03PYAR4J> You're still around, yes? Brunch tomorrow?
<@U03QPG6U1>: Bugger, you also missed out on us gatecrashing a house party afterwards courtesy of @joanne. Lovely to see you this weekend though!
There are clearly too many Brits in New York now, judging from the quality of today's rain.
Nat, Wes, George—apologies for turning up too late at the party. Enjoy the rest of your NYC time!
I'm in for the night after a long day of wandering in amazing sunshine, but would be up for pints (and maybe a quiz) tomorrow evening. Hope the Theorizing all went swimmingly.
Ah, I turned off my notifications for this channel! Best to DM me. Didn't stay out too late, just finishing up my talk. Not sure what the plan is but folk should stop by 250 Bowery!
What's the projected time for this evening?
TtW folks who are here a little early, I am in whynot coffee on orchard st
Thank you Matt! And please do join us, I'll let you know time and place.
Oh! Actually, there's a sister place to the bar we went to on Wednesday after trivia called Dove Parlour on Thompson between 3rd and Bleecker; it's closing soon, too, so we can be nice to the owners who had their rents tripled.
"A dozen or so" is a hard trick to pull off in that neighborhood (and those that can accommodate will be fairly loud) but some ideas are: Ace Bar (E 5th St btwn Ave A and B), Barcade St Marks (St Marks Place between 2nd and 3rd Avenues), Houston Hall (West Houston, near Varick Street), Peculier Pub (Bleecker between Thompson and Laguardia Pl)
I can come (this is post-TTW, yes?). Will let someone who knows the area better come up with options.
Folks! We're going to get drinks tomorrow night with others in town. One, where do you recommend in the east/west/Greenwich village that can accommodate a dozen or so, and two can you come?
Think we're hunkering down in V bar, across from NYU, for a bit
locations of Think Coffee are great for that, and there are several depending on where you are. They'll pretty much let you sit there all day with a latte.
TEAM  - any reccs for coffee places on lower east side or w village where Kane and I can go and hang/get some work done today?
<@U03PXT1KP>: I think my flight gets in around 9pm and I'm assuming there'll be another long crawl through security, so I don't think I can make this one. But! I will be leaving town on the evening of Thurs 23rd, so anything next week would be ace
<@U03PYAR4J>: will you be able to make it? I know pub quiz was on your want-to-do list
For those inclined tomorrow, several of the lab folk were interested in fielding a team here on Wednesday evening: <http://www.petescandystore.com/quizz.html>
Yup, flight out the evening of the 23rd
<@U03PYAR4J>, you're here past the 22nd, right?
Cloud and warm today.  Might spatter a bit of rain.
and what is the NYC weather like?
24 more hours people!
Sorted.
brazenhead at 8 w/ nat, come <@U03PZUMNG>!
Forthwith of the note in <#C03PY52QG>, what are people up to tonight?
It was a very good plot, and very much enjoyed.
(I figured there was some plot)
:simple_smile:
Sorry—I plotted ages ago to drag Nat out to a birthday brunch with me, Ingrid, and the Axis of Kissane.
<@U03PY52P0> where? I didn't know there was a specific plan.
Yes! Will be there in thirty.
Brunch, <@U03PY52P0>?
<@U03QPG6U1>: I meant the thing at Parson.
Oh hells, <@U03PZUMNG>, I thought I told you that there isn't going to be a Deb Con this year, so not sure which conference you're looking at?
(And yes, I owe folks an email making that official.)
I get back from DC Thursday evening late-ish.  I've got an interactive theater thing early on Friday, and I might have a friend's birthday party later that evening.  At some point, more likely Sunday, I'll have another booked evening.  I'm planning on being around for Deb's conference and activities thereafter.  I'm currently planning on flying to SF on Tuesday and not coming back until the 21st at the earliest.
BOTH :goth:
(I'm also keener on doing the Addivist thing on that Thurs than karaoke, though obv as critical party monsters, we can do both)
<@U03QPG6U1>: ha!
Also, as a non-karaoke person, I vote for NYC karaoke on the 16th.
I\m missing the conference that Deb is speaking at by a day, which sucks.
Despite getting into town next Weds, still madly envious of those of you who are there this weekend
Yes, we should. Daniel's on my panel at TTW so would be good to meet him beforehand.
Going to reiterate that there should be some karaoke happening. Also, we should probably check that Additivist event, seems like everyone has been sending me that manifesto in the last couple of days.
Planning on doing an open social from 5:30 to 8:30 at Cowgirl Hall of Fame in the West Village this Saturday, if anyone would like to come. Haven't gotten much farther with NYC planning for either trip.
Exactement
Also not inducing weaponised FOMO amongst our dear friends
Hi all, just opening this channel up for plans/meet ups etc for the next week or so while everyone's visiting so we don't clog up the main channels #organisationface
:tequila:
there’s some weird latency
roll :d20:
/giphy emoji
really upsetting that the side texture isn't the same as top texture :disappointed:
/giphy come on
(was hoping for a Bluth)
/giphy bluth
testing...
test test
ah, because I can’t type
is everyone name dropping Frank now?
What exactly happens on dog social media anyway?
well, that is sort of working...
Sorry—I plotted ages ago to SF on Thompson and I can accommodate a team here a non-karaoke person, I think my panel at the evening
<@U04H9G2FG>: No need to apologise.
(Can we get a vague bot taxonomy pinned up somewhere?)
there’s only one bot…that first message was me making an API call incorrectly
it turns out "bot" is a superset of bots, a voice from the fog of bots always almost responding to us
Botness.
I think <@U04H9G2FG> will now reply if I directly speak to it
Our own personal bot-foglets, interacting with us and those near to us, drinking from the water of our data as it transpires out into the cloud
or not :disappointed:
Oh bot-foglet.
:doner:
See, they got it wrong -- data isn't the new oil, it's the new water.
(or something)
the new spritzer
/giphy spritzer
<@U04H9G2FG>: you’re not listening
can slackbots delete? would be nice to have an #sd equivalent on certain channels
There are here past the street that Thurs than karaoke, though obv as critical party later that the NYC planning for coffee on the evening
No it’s only listening /participating here on mezzanine. (Hi <@U04H9G2FG> !)
BOTH :goth:
ha ha ha ha
THERE NEEDS TO BE A GOTH EMOJI NOW
and NOW it does respond if you directly address it
Trying to fit in
I vote for a variant of that ^^
dang, i had black lips
Feel free to change it.
:goth:
Hm

yep, it works!
mmm, pizza
it’s what’s for lunch
It'd be amusing if <@U04H9G2FG> pulled in text from links dropped in too...
/giphy come (this is a dozen or w village around 11
bot want coffee in west village bad
Relatedly, I was thinking it could keep track of sites we share from and occasionally pick a random link from those domains to share
so, how much in-app SlackCoin™ do I have to buy to get the "BOT" flair?!?!
/giphy flair
oops
Think we're hunkering down the night after trivia called Dove Parlour on lavendar cocktails
this is like accidentally summoning the wrong ghost
<@U04H9G2FG>: in fairness, that was a pretty full-on night
Sorted
@alm m8
i love the idea of wasting a ghost's time, though - an exasperated specter returns, _again_, because you haven't gotten over the novelty of finding a working spell
i think that happened to Notorious BIG
