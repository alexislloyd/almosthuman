They were delicious cocktails, and led to a very fuzzy final day in NY
Nah, that's about right for New York.
Sorry.

Well I'll have to add it to my list next time I visit.

and you can see through a big window into the distilley and drool at equipment while imbibing tasty cocktails
Wow
Yes, but NoJ was once again very loud with DJ, so <@U03PX4FGH> found an aMAZing cocktail bar down the street that distills its own gin
<@U03PX4FGH>: Did you get <@U03PYAR4J> merry on lavendar cocktails too?
<@U03PYAR4J>: Oh good, you're functioning!
<@U03PZUMNG>: yes - somewhere in west village around 11.30?
<@U03PYAR4J> You're still around, yes? Brunch tomorrow?
<@U03QPG6U1>: Bugger, you also missed out on us gatecrashing a house party afterwards courtesy of @joanne. Lovely to see you this weekend though!
There are clearly too many Brits in New York now, judging from the quality of today's rain.
Nat, Wes, George—apologies for turning up too late at the party. Enjoy the rest of your NYC time!
I'm in for the night after a long day of wandering in amazing sunshine, but would be up for pints (and maybe a quiz) tomorrow evening. Hope the Theorizing all went swimmingly.
Ah, I turned off my notifications for this channel! Best to DM me. Didn't stay out too late, just finishing up my talk. Not sure what the plan is but folk should stop by 250 Bowery!
What's the projected time for this evening?
TtW folks who are here a little early, I am in whynot coffee on orchard st
Thank you Matt! And please do join us, I'll let you know time and place.
Oh! Actually, there's a sister place to the bar we went to on Wednesday after trivia called Dove Parlour on Thompson between 3rd and Bleecker; it's closing soon, too, so we can be nice to the owners who had their rents tripled.
"A dozen or so" is a hard trick to pull off in that neighborhood (and those that can accommodate will be fairly loud) but some ideas are: Ace Bar (E 5th St btwn Ave A and B), Barcade St Marks (St Marks Place between 2nd and 3rd Avenues), Houston Hall (West Houston, near Varick Street), Peculier Pub (Bleecker between Thompson and Laguardia Pl)
I can come (this is post-TTW, yes?). Will let someone who knows the area better come up with options.
Folks! We're going to get drinks tomorrow night with others in town. One, where do you recommend in the east/west/Greenwich village that can accommodate a dozen or so, and two can you come?
Think we're hunkering down in V bar, across from NYU, for a bit
locations of Think Coffee are great for that, and there are several depending on where you are. They'll pretty much let you sit there all day with a latte.
TEAM  - any reccs for coffee places on lower east side or w village where Kane and I can go and hang/get some work done today?
<@U03PXT1KP>: I think my flight gets in around 9pm and I'm assuming there'll be another long crawl through security, so I don't think I can make this one. But! I will be leaving town on the evening of Thurs 23rd, so anything next week would be ace
<@U03PYAR4J>: will you be able to make it? I know pub quiz was on your want-to-do list
For those inclined tomorrow, several of the lab folk were interested in fielding a team here on Wednesday evening: <http://www.petescandystore.com/quizz.html>
Yup, flight out the evening of the 23rd
<@U03PYAR4J>, you're here past the 22nd, right?
Cloud and warm today.  Might spatter a bit of rain.
and what is the NYC weather like?
24 more hours people!
Sorted.
brazenhead at 8 w/ nat, come <@U03PZUMNG>!
Forthwith of the note in <#C03PY52QG>, what are people up to tonight?
It was a very good plot, and very much enjoyed.
(I figured there was some plot)
:simple_smile:
Sorry—I plotted ages ago to drag Nat out to a birthday brunch with me, Ingrid, and the Axis of Kissane.
<@U03PY52P0> where? I didn't know there was a specific plan.
Yes! Will be there in thirty.
Brunch, <@U03PY52P0>?
<@U03QPG6U1>: I meant the thing at Parson.
Oh hells, <@U03PZUMNG>, I thought I told you that there isn't going to be a Deb Con this year, so not sure which conference you're looking at?
(And yes, I owe folks an email making that official.)
I get back from DC Thursday evening late-ish.  I've got an interactive theater thing early on Friday, and I might have a friend's birthday party later that evening.  At some point, more likely Sunday, I'll have another booked evening.  I'm planning on being around for Deb's conference and activities thereafter.  I'm currently planning on flying to SF on Tuesday and not coming back until the 21st at the earliest.
BOTH :goth:
(I'm also keener on doing the Addivist thing on that Thurs than karaoke, though obv as critical party monsters, we can do both)
<@U03QPG6U1>: ha!
Also, as a non-karaoke person, I vote for NYC karaoke on the 16th.
I\m missing the conference that Deb is speaking at by a day, which sucks.
Despite getting into town next Weds, still madly envious of those of you who are there this weekend
Yes, we should. Daniel's on my panel at TTW so would be good to meet him beforehand.
Going to reiterate that there should be some karaoke happening. Also, we should probably check that Additivist event, seems like everyone has been sending me that manifesto in the last couple of days.
Planning on doing an open social from 5:30 to 8:30 at Cowgirl Hall of Fame in the West Village this Saturday, if anyone would like to come. Haven't gotten much farther with NYC planning for either trip.

ie. what we think of as the 'goth' emoji...
<@U03PY52P0>, <@U03PXT1KP> Need your input... I'm putting together a presentation on Kantian Aesthetics for Smith Jr's AP Philosophy class and I'm thinking of using Velazquez as my primary example of meeting Kant's four rules for defining "aesthetic beauty." Mainly by pointing out how many other artistic "geniuses" (by Kant's definition) were influenced by his work and how often other artists copied and re-copied him to learn how to create beautiful art. Picasso, Dali, Bacon, etc. 

Velazquez could technically be called a very (very) early Enlightenment-era artist, but I think he makes a great example of an artist who broke away from the strong religious influence in art (Pope Innocent X, notwithstanding) and used quite a bit of sciency-wiency technique in his compositions. 

Am I reaching too hard for a talk to 16-18 year olds? Would love any suggestions or questions that might help me build a better slideshow.... Planning on a quick art history round-up denoting the main influencers of (western) art in each era, e.g. religion, politics, philosophy, utility, etc., then use Sr Diego to illustrate Kant's four principles and why this seemed a reasonable way to make a value judgement at that time.

Everyone else feel free to jump in with commentary...

<@U03PWSASX>: Hmm, I have thoughts on this and I definitely don't think you're over stretching. When I get to a desktop I'll type this up clearly.
<@U03PWSASX>: quick thoughts (also my usual tactic) might be to start with something comparable and contemporary, as a way of hooking in interest and familiarity, then moving deeper into Velazquez.
<@U03S7FVFK>: I probably need to have it done this week. They start their AP exams next week, but we don't have a fixed date yet.
<@U03PWSASX>: not even something to riff off him; more something similar but contemporary (people mimicking a style and why) before bringing it over

<@U03PWSASX>: Controversy in art usually sits on that spectrum of whether something is right/moral compared to whether it is 'good', so that might be an interesting conversation. Where aesthetics are muddled by the works morality. If that makes sense.
But beware going down the flash bang controversy route.
Of course Kant would argue that moral value might be the most important aspect of creativity, I think he wanted to take out all possibility of controversy, in that by applying "rules" to art, one might draw a bright line between what is "good" art and what is "not good" art. The main thrust of the talk is to help the kiddos understand how philosophers tried to frame the answers to questions about everything in the world, and at the time of the enlightenment, that world was embracing scientific over religious ideals, popular rule over monarchy and common good over aristocratic dominance. The times, they were a changin'.
Hmm. might be interesting to look at the Dadaists, who a bit later, dealt with rationalism as a reaction. Generally all of that lot - reacting against the fact art had to 'mean something', and pushed against the academy somewhat, seeing things in isolation from their context as an affront to the religious art history that proceeded it. My specialities in terms of aaarrrtt are mainly the futurists (surprise surprise), german/russian conceptual architecture, 60's abstract expressionists and then this digital contemporary nonsense. Although Velasquez is pretty damn good.
But I'm not sure, as that's a big leap forward in terms of history.
Man, Bruce does not like being called out when he makes a joke in bad taste.
I saw that E.
Not his reaction though, has he replied?
He's DMing me and digging a bigger and bigger hole.
What is he saying? Clearly he should know that what he said is pretty fucking insensitive.
Eh, I don't actually want to cut and paste, but basically claiming that what he said is somehow "true" and trying to pull the harder-than-thou thing.
Which lol

<@U03PXBZN1>: to be fair though, your conference was called *haunted* machines, not *magic* machines. They may not think they have co-opted you at all. {runs away in abject terror of imminent academic wrath}
The learntosearch tweet was pretty hilarious, tho.
<@U03PWSASX>: totes fair, not SO bothered by that. The co-opting of magic full stop by the academy is a fucktastrophe forget the last few years of work being done by actual fuckin artists and stuff about it
<@U03PXBZN1>: since I'm currently putting together a talk about artists co-opting another artist's work to point out that great artists often shamelessly copy other great artists ideas, I'm afraid I couldn't possibly comment.
Even Miliband is co-opting magick. <http://i.guim.co.uk/media/w-620/h--/q-95/76f118a520ca2960525d8ef27565b3f05c9bcc1e/0_0_4508_2704/1000.jpg>

Comme/Watanabe++
That's my leather jacket.
Capes++ too, frankly. And at some point I will end up with an ACR piece, but I haven't seen the right thing from them yet, and no where stocks their women's line.
And yes, I think we do need to ensure that we come at CSM with a unified and strategic response for this.
My concern is twofold -- first, making sure that the folks who largely brought this to their attention get credit, and secondly (and somewhat more importantly), ensuring that they don't get to whitewash what is otherwise a fairly effective way of talking about power in technology.
I mean, the latter will happen sooner or later, of course, but I'd like to keep the critique at least somewhat fucking effective.
what does ACR stand for? goog thinks I mean McMaster-Carr, but that's because goog knows what I like
Proudly carried Ramones, Smiths, Bowie
<@U04KD3F7T> Acronym
Because <@U04KD3F7T> will probably appreciate this, I will note that, despite appearances, McMaster-Carr might be the most functional website I regularly use. It is only apparent when you try to find something like an 8x8" sheet of 1/4" commercially pure titanium.
Now I've walked through other room and <@U03PWSASX> is just mumbling McM-Carr product categories and squeeing.
Thanks y'all.
OMG how did I never know about this? A few years ago I was looking for clear acrylic rods to use as drapery rods. McMaster Carr has had them all along! So much cool stuff!
Oh, yeah, it's amazing.
Also, Thomas Scientific and Small Parts, although I think the latter have been absorbed into something?  Maybe Amazon?
YES <@U03QPG6U1>!! I consistently point to it as the single best-designed website I know of. When I was building Temboo's product, I was constantly sending mcmaster links as examples of excellent contextual/library interfaces
and last year, I casually mentioned how much I loved that site and a lady who was visiting said "oh yeah, I was an information architect on that project" zomg :heart: :heart: :heart:

Come to class with me, It'll wake you up.
oh and its due tomorrow
I had one of those today, <@U03PY6S80> . I got around it by just half-assing it.
My editor at the nation just finally got back to me today. I gave them the first draft of the piece two weeks ago.  In theory, their deadline is tomorrow; they want to talk in the morning.  I may cut them.
Can't you just dip into the US strategic ass reserve?

I dropped out of high school to go to university, and I went to grad school even though I flunked my last semester of engineering school, so I'm either the poster child for 'stay in school' or the worst exemplar ever. Today was the last day of classes--now at home editing drafts of student work so they can do revisions over the weekend.
getting weird and meta post-6PM. Bouncing narrative between Watson and Russian gulags. Pity the editor.
Things which make me very happy: Having finally done the work of setting up twitter lists so I can ignore my main timeline but still read posts from folks I care about who aren't caught by littletwitter.
Big Methodology.
Heh made a private account a while back for the purpose of replying to other private accounts (that's what constitutes littletwitter I guess?)
Then proceeded to unfollow those private accounts from my main. This is the story of how I found out a non-neglibile percentage of my timeline was cross-chatter between the private &amp; public accounts of <@U03PY6S80> &amp; <@U03PY52P0>.

Well, here we go, then:
<http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/01/tesla-announces-low-cost-solar-batteries-elon-musk>
What do you reckon, Paul?
Obvs the business model around these is a worrying factor, but even so, those batteries change the landscape.
Storage is the missing link for renewables.
Thought it was interesting they were targeting generators directly. Interesting approach to scale &amp; scaling.
Decentralisation of generation, distro and supply now feasible.
Prices too high for retail market, I'd have thought; stick with the outfits with r&amp;d budgets and a worrying scenario suite
Building a supply chain though, innit.

<@U03PXBZN1> Also kinda inevitable; vape couture x 100
(Says he's treating the Gigafactory as a product, prototype of turnkey manufacturing capacity)
Hells as to what it'll do to the lithium market, though.
<@U03S7FVFK> Building that chain is why Musk's in the game; everyone wants in on the physical layers of the stacks.
Yeah, rare earths too; interesting times.
The patents are supposedly open, does that mean much of anything? Has it for the Tesla motor patents that were open since last year at all?
"Since Tesla open-sourced its patents, there have been more and better electric cars, and independent engineers have contacted the company with design ideas": <http://www.cheatsheet.com/technology/why-tech-companies-are-letting-others-use-their-designs.html/?a=viewall#ixzz3YspWFg1o>
(Not sure how huge the impact, but good for identifying &amp; hoovering up talent?)
Id want the opinion of someone who knows IP law better than i do, but I'd guess he figures he has First Starter's advantage, and no one can throw money at it as quickly as he can; just secures his position in the assemblage, if anything.
Don't wanna rule out a genuine altruism on his part, though; sometimes crazy people do good things for good reasons.
Hey, <@U03PYAR4J> - looks like we're both doing that Ings thing at the BFI end of the month. :)
Another note from the innovation/drugs nexus: <http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/01/chinese-labs-legal-highs-west-drugs>
Interesting to see them trace the synthesis boom to the destruction of a stock of safrole; IIRC, it was the discovery of safrole as a reliable MDMA precursor that was behind the minor pill renaissance not long after the millennium; anyone else remember them Mitsubishis? Nostalgia aside, great case study in black market supply-chain logistics.
<@U042AQREM>: Yeah, I need to figure that out too. Twitter isn't making this easy.
<@U03PY6S80> Could be a lark.
