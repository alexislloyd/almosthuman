They were delicious cocktails, and led to a very fuzzy final day in NY
Nah, that's about right for New York.
Sorry.

Well I'll have to add it to my list next time I visit.

and you can see through a big window into the distilley and drool at equipment while imbibing tasty cocktails
Wow
Yes, but NoJ was once again very loud with DJ, so <@U03PX4FGH> found an aMAZing cocktail bar down the street that distills its own gin
<@U03PX4FGH>: Did you get <@U03PYAR4J> merry on lavendar cocktails too?
<@U03PYAR4J>: Oh good, you're functioning!
<@U03PZUMNG>: yes - somewhere in west village around 11.30?
<@U03PYAR4J> You're still around, yes? Brunch tomorrow?
<@U03QPG6U1>: Bugger, you also missed out on us gatecrashing a house party afterwards courtesy of @joanne. Lovely to see you this weekend though!
There are clearly too many Brits in New York now, judging from the quality of today's rain.
Nat, Wes, George—apologies for turning up too late at the party. Enjoy the rest of your NYC time!
I'm in for the night after a long day of wandering in amazing sunshine, but would be up for pints (and maybe a quiz) tomorrow evening. Hope the Theorizing all went swimmingly.
Ah, I turned off my notifications for this channel! Best to DM me. Didn't stay out too late, just finishing up my talk. Not sure what the plan is but folk should stop by 250 Bowery!
What's the projected time for this evening?
TtW folks who are here a little early, I am in whynot coffee on orchard st
Thank you Matt! And please do join us, I'll let you know time and place.
Oh! Actually, there's a sister place to the bar we went to on Wednesday after trivia called Dove Parlour on Thompson between 3rd and Bleecker; it's closing soon, too, so we can be nice to the owners who had their rents tripled.
"A dozen or so" is a hard trick to pull off in that neighborhood (and those that can accommodate will be fairly loud) but some ideas are: Ace Bar (E 5th St btwn Ave A and B), Barcade St Marks (St Marks Place between 2nd and 3rd Avenues), Houston Hall (West Houston, near Varick Street), Peculier Pub (Bleecker between Thompson and Laguardia Pl)
I can come (this is post-TTW, yes?). Will let someone who knows the area better come up with options.
Folks! We're going to get drinks tomorrow night with others in town. One, where do you recommend in the east/west/Greenwich village that can accommodate a dozen or so, and two can you come?
Think we're hunkering down in V bar, across from NYU, for a bit
locations of Think Coffee are great for that, and there are several depending on where you are. They'll pretty much let you sit there all day with a latte.
TEAM  - any reccs for coffee places on lower east side or w village where Kane and I can go and hang/get some work done today?
<@U03PXT1KP>: I think my flight gets in around 9pm and I'm assuming there'll be another long crawl through security, so I don't think I can make this one. But! I will be leaving town on the evening of Thurs 23rd, so anything next week would be ace
<@U03PYAR4J>: will you be able to make it? I know pub quiz was on your want-to-do list
For those inclined tomorrow, several of the lab folk were interested in fielding a team here on Wednesday evening: <http://www.petescandystore.com/quizz.html>
Yup, flight out the evening of the 23rd
<@U03PYAR4J>, you're here past the 22nd, right?
Cloud and warm today.  Might spatter a bit of rain.
and what is the NYC weather like?
24 more hours people!
Sorted.
brazenhead at 8 w/ nat, come <@U03PZUMNG>!
Forthwith of the note in <#C03PY52QG>, what are people up to tonight?
It was a very good plot, and very much enjoyed.
(I figured there was some plot)
:simple_smile:
Sorry—I plotted ages ago to drag Nat out to a birthday brunch with me, Ingrid, and the Axis of Kissane.
<@U03PY52P0> where? I didn't know there was a specific plan.
Yes! Will be there in thirty.
Brunch, <@U03PY52P0>?
<@U03QPG6U1>: I meant the thing at Parson.
Oh hells, <@U03PZUMNG>, I thought I told you that there isn't going to be a Deb Con this year, so not sure which conference you're looking at?
(And yes, I owe folks an email making that official.)
I get back from DC Thursday evening late-ish.  I've got an interactive theater thing early on Friday, and I might have a friend's birthday party later that evening.  At some point, more likely Sunday, I'll have another booked evening.  I'm planning on being around for Deb's conference and activities thereafter.  I'm currently planning on flying to SF on Tuesday and not coming back until the 21st at the earliest.
BOTH :goth:
(I'm also keener on doing the Addivist thing on that Thurs than karaoke, though obv as critical party monsters, we can do both)
<@U03QPG6U1>: ha!
Also, as a non-karaoke person, I vote for NYC karaoke on the 16th.
I\m missing the conference that Deb is speaking at by a day, which sucks.
Despite getting into town next Weds, still madly envious of those of you who are there this weekend
Yes, we should. Daniel's on my panel at TTW so would be good to meet him beforehand.
Going to reiterate that there should be some karaoke happening. Also, we should probably check that Additivist event, seems like everyone has been sending me that manifesto in the last couple of days.
Planning on doing an open social from 5:30 to 8:30 at Cowgirl Hall of Fame in the West Village this Saturday, if anyone would like to come. Haven't gotten much farther with NYC planning for either trip.

ie. what we think of as the 'goth' emoji...
<@U03PY52P0>, <@U03PXT1KP> Need your input... I'm putting together a presentation on Kantian Aesthetics for Smith Jr's AP Philosophy class and I'm thinking of using Velazquez as my primary example of meeting Kant's four rules for defining "aesthetic beauty." Mainly by pointing out how many other artistic "geniuses" (by Kant's definition) were influenced by his work and how often other artists copied and re-copied him to learn how to create beautiful art. Picasso, Dali, Bacon, etc. 

Velazquez could technically be called a very (very) early Enlightenment-era artist, but I think he makes a great example of an artist who broke away from the strong religious influence in art (Pope Innocent X, notwithstanding) and used quite a bit of sciency-wiency technique in his compositions. 

Am I reaching too hard for a talk to 16-18 year olds? Would love any suggestions or questions that might help me build a better slideshow.... Planning on a quick art history round-up denoting the main influencers of (western) art in each era, e.g. religion, politics, philosophy, utility, etc., then use Sr Diego to illustrate Kant's four principles and why this seemed a reasonable way to make a value judgement at that time.

Everyone else feel free to jump in with commentary...

<@U03PWSASX>: Hmm, I have thoughts on this and I definitely don't think you're over stretching. When I get to a desktop I'll type this up clearly.
<@U03PWSASX>: quick thoughts (also my usual tactic) might be to start with something comparable and contemporary, as a way of hooking in interest and familiarity, then moving deeper into Velazquez.
<@U03S7FVFK>: I probably need to have it done this week. They start their AP exams next week, but we don't have a fixed date yet.
<@U03PWSASX>: not even something to riff off him; more something similar but contemporary (people mimicking a style and why) before bringing it over

<@U03PWSASX>: Controversy in art usually sits on that spectrum of whether something is right/moral compared to whether it is 'good', so that might be an interesting conversation. Where aesthetics are muddled by the works morality. If that makes sense.
But beware going down the flash bang controversy route.
Of course Kant would argue that moral value might be the most important aspect of creativity, I think he wanted to take out all possibility of controversy, in that by applying "rules" to art, one might draw a bright line between what is "good" art and what is "not good" art. The main thrust of the talk is to help the kiddos understand how philosophers tried to frame the answers to questions about everything in the world, and at the time of the enlightenment, that world was embracing scientific over religious ideals, popular rule over monarchy and common good over aristocratic dominance. The times, they were a changin'.
Hmm. might be interesting to look at the Dadaists, who a bit later, dealt with rationalism as a reaction. Generally all of that lot - reacting against the fact art had to 'mean something', and pushed against the academy somewhat, seeing things in isolation from their context as an affront to the religious art history that proceeded it. My specialities in terms of aaarrrtt are mainly the futurists (surprise surprise), german/russian conceptual architecture, 60's abstract expressionists and then this digital contemporary nonsense. Although Velasquez is pretty damn good.
But I'm not sure, as that's a big leap forward in terms of history.
Man, Bruce does not like being called out when he makes a joke in bad taste.
I saw that E.
Not his reaction though, has he replied?
He's DMing me and digging a bigger and bigger hole.
What is he saying? Clearly he should know that what he said is pretty fucking insensitive.
Eh, I don't actually want to cut and paste, but basically claiming that what he said is somehow "true" and trying to pull the harder-than-thou thing.
Which lol
